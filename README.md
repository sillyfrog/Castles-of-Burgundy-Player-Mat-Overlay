# Castles-of-Burgundy-Player-Mat-Overlay
Castles of Burgundy Player Mat Overlay OpenSCAD Source

An overlay for The Castles of Burgundy player mats, to keeps the hexes in place while playing and avoid a disaster if things get knocked. See the compiled STL files on Thingiverse here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2944971

The size of the final product was so it would fit on my printer (just!), an Anet A8. Also, that way it can fit in the original box rotated 90Â° (as the lips for the edges make it too wide otherwise).

When printing, print *upside down*, that way the smooth surface of the printer bed is what you will see, and the "lips" (to keep it in place) will be the last things printed protruding from the top.

Most things are driven by the constants at the top of the file. The width of the `HEX_EDGE` (ie: the actual plastic between the hexes), I have adjusted so it would be solid when sliced for my printer, this may need tweaking for your setup. I found when it was slightly higher, there was a gap in the printed plastic, causing the print to easily come apart.

I printed at 0.2mm Z-Layer resolution with no supports or infill.
